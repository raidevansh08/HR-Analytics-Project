# HR-Analytics-Project
Predictive analytics in identifying the employees who are most likely to get promoted.

## Title:
Prediction of employees’ promotions to facilitate process expedition

## Description:
An MNC struggles to find the best candidates for promotion (only for manager positions
and below) and ensure their timely preparation. They currently operate a three-step process
that entails selecting a group of people, training them, and evaluating them afterward.
These procedures delay transitioning to their new responsibilities because the
final promotions are only given once completed. For the company to hasten
the promotion process, we need to predict the qualified candidates for promotion.

## Methodology:
1. Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the patterns of each variable.
2. Normalize the data to bring them to a common scale, detect the outliers, and treat
them as required.
3. Define model evaluation parameters depending on various factors and the
problem's expressions of interest. Here as the company demands, we’re going to
use F1 Score.
4. Build a model and enhance the model. Examples include neural networks, random
forests, logistic regression, and support vector machines.
5. Perform model comparison to find the best model for the defined problem and
evaluation parameter.
